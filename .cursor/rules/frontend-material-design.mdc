# Frontend Design Rules (Material Design)

Use Material Design for a consistent, unified frontend. Apply these rules to all UI work.

## Design system

- **Material Design**: Follow Material Design 3 (M3) patterns for layout, components, and behavior.
- **Consistency**: Keep designs unified across the plugin (same spacing, elevation, typography scale).

## Icons

- **Material Design Icons**: Use Material Design Icons (Material Icons / Material Symbols) only.
- Prefer icon font or SVG from [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) or [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons); avoid mixing other icon sets.

## Animations

- Use animations where they add clarity (e.g. transitions, micro-interactions, loading states).
- Prefer Material motion: short durations (200–300ms), standard easing (e.g. `cubic-bezier`).
- Use for: hover/focus feedback, page/section transitions, list reorder, dialogs open/close, loading indicators.

## Loading states

- **Skeleton loading**: Where content is loading (lists, cards, tables, detail views), show **skeleton** placeholders (skeleton screens / shimmer) instead of only spinners.
- Use skeleton components that match the final layout (e.g. skeleton rows for tables, skeleton cards for grids).
- Keep skeletons subtle; use the project color palette at low opacity or a neutral gray.

## Color palette

Use this palette for primary UI, accents, and states. Keep usage consistent.

| Usage        | Hex       |
|-------------|-----------|
| Primary     | `#46a9c6` |
| Primary alt | `#4bb6d3` |
| Accent      | `#6ef2cc` |

- **Primary** (`#46a9c6`): Main buttons, links, key actions, primary app color.
- **Primary alt** (`#4bb6d3`): Hover/active states, secondary emphasis.
- **Accent** (`#6ef2cc`): Success, highlights, positive actions, optional accent elements.

Define these as CSS variables for reuse, e.g.:

```css
:root {
  --plugitify-primary: #46a9c6;
  --plugitify-primary-alt: #4bb6d3;
  --plugitify-accent: #6ef2cc;
}
```

Use them for backgrounds, borders, text, and focus rings so the UI stays consistent.
